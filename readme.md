# This is my work as a RISE UP Intern in IIT Jammu under Dr. Harish Pothukuchi !

#### It is a summer research Intern where I have to work on One Dimensional subchannel analysis on two fluid model in two phases in PVR.

#### Mainly I am converting 3D equations of Navier Stokes Equations in two fluid model in 1D by using SIMPLE (Semi - Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) method.

### There are total three equations:

- Continuity Equation
- Momentum Equation
- Energy Equation
